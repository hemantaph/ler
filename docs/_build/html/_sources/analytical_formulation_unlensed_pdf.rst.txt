Overview
--------

This document presents the analytical framework for calculating gravitational-wave (GW) event rates from compact-binary coalescences (CBCs), encompassing binary black holes (BBH), binary neutron stars (BNS), and neutron star–black hole binaries (NSBH). The formulation combines cosmic merger-rate densities with detector sensitivity and selection effects to predict annual detection rates.

Key Topics Covered
------------------

* Parameter-marginalized event rates
* Redshift distribution and intrinsic merger rates
* Detection criterion and SNR modeling
* Simulation results and rate estimates
* GW source parameter priors
