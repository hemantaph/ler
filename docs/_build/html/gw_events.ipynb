If $\\rho(z_s,\\theta) \\geq \\rho_{th}$, the event is considered detectable.\n",
    "- The SNR threshold $\\mathbf{\\rho_{th}}$ is typically chosen based on the sensitivity and design specifications of the gravitational wave detector. This strategy is valid as a proxy in the Gaussian noise regime.\n",

    "The integration over $z_s$ and $\\theta$ in the equation accounts for the contributions from all detectable events across different redshifts and with varying gravitational wave parameters. This comprehensive approach enables the estimation of the annual rate of detectable gravitational wave events, which is crucial for understanding the observational capabilities of gravitational wave detectors and planning future observational strategies.\n",
